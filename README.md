# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
My goal is to create a regression model comparing bike stations around poi's.

## Process
### Gather all data, put data in the right place
### Make sure the data is in usable condition
### Proceed with the regression

## Results
Yelp overall seemed to be a better place to get info from. The coverage was far better than foursquare. 

## Challenges 
Many challenges every step of the way, from simple api calling to the actual model itself. 

## Future Goals
If i had more time, i would absolutley make sure the data was in better shape before running a regression.
